## Code Standards

### Dart Code Style

Follow [Effective Dart](https://dart.dev/guides/language/effective-dart) guidelines:

1. **Naming Conventions**
   - Class names: `PascalCase`
   - Functions/Variables: `camelCase`
   - Constants: `lowerCamelCase` (Dart convention)
   - Private members: prefix with `_`

2. **Formatting**
   - Use `dart format` for auto-formatting
   - 80 character line limit
   - Use 2-space indentation

3. **Comments**
   - Use `///` for public API documentation
   - Add inline comments for complex logic
   - Avoid meaningless comments

```dart
/// Calculate total income and expenses for a specific month
///
/// [ledgerId] Ledger ID
/// [year] Year
/// [month] Month (1-12)
/// Returns a Map containing income and expenses
Future<Map<String, double>> calculateMonthlyTotal(
  int ledgerId,
  int year,
  int month,
) async {
  // Implementation...
}
```

4. **Null Safety**
   - Fully utilize Dart's null safety features
   - Avoid using `!` force unwrap, use `?.` and `??`
   - Function parameters use `required` or provide default values

### Flutter Component Standards

1. **Widget Structure**
   - Prefer `const` constructors
   - Break large widgets into smaller components
   - `build` method returns a single widget

2. **State Management**
   - Use Riverpod for state management
   - Provider names end with `Provider`
   - Avoid direct database operations in widgets

```dart
final ledgersProvider = FutureProvider<List<Ledger>>((ref) async {
  final repo = ref.watch(repositoryProvider);
  return repo.getAllLedgers();
});
```

3. **Performance Optimization**
   - Use `const` widgets
   - Avoid creating new objects in `build` method
   - Properly use `ListView.builder`

### Database Standards

1. **Drift Table Definitions**
   - Table names use plural (`Transactions`, `Categories`)
   - Field names use camelCase
   - Add necessary indexes

```dart
class Transactions extends Table {
  IntColumn get id => integer().autoIncrement()();
  IntColumn get ledgerId => integer().references(Ledgers, #id)();
  TextColumn get description => text().nullable()();
  RealColumn get amount => real()();
  DateTimeColumn get date => dateTime()();
  DateTimeColumn get createdAt => dateTime().withDefault(currentDateAndTime)();

  @override
  Set<Column> get primaryKey => {id};
}
```

2. **Query Optimization**
   - Use indexes to speed up queries
   - Avoid N+1 queries
   - Use streaming queries to respond to data changes

## Commit Message Convention

We use a commit convention based on [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/), **in Chinese**.

### Format

```
<type>: <short description>

[optional detailed description]

[optional footer]
```

### Types

- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `refactor`: Code refactoring (no functionality change)
- `style`: Code formatting (no functionality impact)
- `perf`: Performance optimization
- `test`: Add or modify tests
- `docs`: Documentation updates
- `chore`: Build process or auxiliary tool changes
- `ci`: CI/CD configuration changes
- `revert`: Revert previous commit

### Examples

```bash
# New feature
git commit -m "feat: 添加预算功能"

# Bug fix
git commit -m "fix: 修复云同步时数据丢失的问题"

# With detailed description
git commit -m "refactor: 重构数据库查询逻辑

- 优化索引使用
- 减少冗余查询
- 提升查询性能约 30%"

# Documentation update
git commit -m "docs: 更新 Supabase 配置文档"

# Performance optimization
git commit -m "perf: 优化首页列表渲染性能"
```

### Notes

- Use Chinese descriptions
- Short description under 50 characters
- Use imperative mood ("add" not "added")
- Detailed description explains "why" not "what"

### Adding a New Language

1. **Create Translation File**

Create a new `.arb` file in the `lib/l10n/` directory:

```
lib/l10n/app_<language_code>.arb
```

For example, adding Italian:
```
lib/l10n/app_it.arb
```

2. **Copy Template**

Copy the content of `app_en.arb` and translate all strings:

```json
{
  "appName": "BeeCount",
  "home": "Casa",
  "charts": "Grafici",
  "ledgers": "Conti",
  "mine": "Mio",
  ...
}
```

3. **Test Translation**

```bash
flutter pub get
flutter run
```

Switch to the new language in app settings and check the translation.

4. **Submit PR**

```bash
git add lib/l10n/app_it.arb
git commit -m "feat: 添加意大利语翻译"
git push origin feature/add-italian-translation
```

### Improving Existing Translations
